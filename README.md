# Adaptive power line interference canceller (Python version)

This is a Python implementation of the algorithm proposed in __Mohammad Reza Keshtkaran and Zhi Yang, "A Fast, Robust Algorithm for Power Line Interference Cancellation in Neural Recording", Journal of Neural Engineering 11 026017__, available from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6862.pdf). The Python version is port of the MATLAB code provided by [mrezak](https://github.com/mrezak) at [removePLI](https://github.com/mrezak/removePLI). Currently only the single channel version of the algorithm is implemented.

The [IPython Notebook](https://github.com/alafuzof/remove_pli/blob/master/README.md) shows how the code may be used and compares the results of the Python and MATLAB implementations.
